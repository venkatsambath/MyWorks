Hi Eisen,

Thank you for contacting cloudera support. 

My name is Venkat, Customer Operations Engineer from IST timezone. The patch HIVE-10202 has already been backported to CDH5.3.4 and later versions. 

Could you please try running the query with --silent option set to true and try again.

For Example:
beeline -u "jdbc:hive2://<hostname>:10000/default" -n hive -p dummy --silent=true --showHeader=false --outputformat=tsv2 -f test.hql

The reason being that when running a query through beeline the default value for --silent option will be false which makes the results to have the prompts being shown in the STDOUT. This can be overridden by setting the parameter to false.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Venkat
