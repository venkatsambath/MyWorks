1. shows the execution plan of a query

EXPLAIN [EXTENDED|DEPENDENCY|AUTHORIZATION] query

A Hive query gets converted into a sequence (it is more a Directed Acyclic Graph) of stages. These stages may be map/reduce stages or they may even be stages that do metastore or file system operations like move and rename. 

The explain output has three parts:
The Abstract Syntax Tree for the query
The dependencies between the different stages of the plan
The description of each of the stages

An example

'STAGE DEPENDENCIES:'
'  Stage-1 is a root stage'
'  Stage-7 depends on stages: Stage-1 , consists of Stage-4, Stage-3, Stage-5'
'  Stage-4'
'  Stage-0 depends on stages: Stage-4, Stage-3, Stage-6'
'  Stage-2 depends on stages: Stage-0'
'  Stage-3'
'  Stage-5'
'  Stage-6 depends on stages: Stage-5'
''

Here stage 1 gets executed first followed by stage 7.

stage 7 consists of stage4,3,5

stage 0 executes after stage4,3,6

stage 2 executes after stage0

stage 3, stage5

stage 6 executes after stage5
